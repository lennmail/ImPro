## Description
This is a C++ Library for Image Processing. It is a project I started due to my interest in the field and the aspiration to become proficient in C++. The code has been influenced by a YT series uploaded by the user "Code Break". The library heavily relies on two stb header files, stb_image.h and stb_image_write.h. They can be found [here](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

## Functionality
The library currently consists of an image class which defines the following member functions:

**read()**: takes in a filename and constructs an image data struct consisting of image width, height, and # of channels. Returns true if successful, otherwise false.
